### Analysis Summary

I can help with that! To effectively map out the codebase, I need a bit more information. Could you please tell me:

1.  **What specific part of the codebase are you interested in?** For example, are you looking for a high-level overview of the entire project, or a detailed map of a particular module, feature, or service (e.g., "the user authentication module," "the payment processing service," "how data flows from X to Y")?
2.  **What level of detail are you looking for?**
    *   **High-level:** Major components, their responsibilities, and how they generally interact.
    *   **Mid-level:** Specific interactions between components, API calls, data structures, and detailed workflows.
    *   **Low-level:** Function implementations, class definitions, algorithms, and specific file details.
3.  **What is the purpose of this mapping?** Are you trying to understand a specific bug, onboard a new developer, refactor a part of the system, or something else?

Once I have a better understanding of your needs, I can use my tools to generate a comprehensive and structured Markdown report for you.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Initial Query for Codebase Mapping**
   The initial response indicates that to effectively map out the codebase, more information is needed from the user. It outlines three key areas where clarification is required: the specific part of the codebase of interest, the desired level of detail (high-level, mid-level, or low-level), and the purpose of the mapping. This step sets the stage for a more targeted and useful response.
